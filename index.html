        I first started teaching myself programming in September 2019. Today is
        June 11 2020. This blog dates back to 16 April, when I started Khan
        Academy's Computer Programming course and is written retrospectively.
        Ideally I'd have written these posts when they happened, when things were
        fresh in my mind but I'll try my best nonetheless. There are 7 courses,
        in this order:<br><br>Intro into JS: Drawing and Animation.<br><br>Intro into
        HTML/CSS: Making webpages.<br><br>Intro into SQL: Querying and managing data.
        <br><br>Advanced JS: Games and visualizations:<br><br>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations.
        <br><br>HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive.<br><br>HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive

I also want be able to download and use JS code from GitHub. I'll have more skills to add to my CV, as well.</p>

It's feels simplistic and for kids but I try to not stress about it,  you have to start somewhere, right?  Since coronavirus is
          taking over our lives, I thought I'd incorporate it into my work. So the magic 8-ball looks like a germ cell. Perhaps I could
          make a coronavirus based Space Invaders... </p>

          a 'Bookshelf' project using an Array of Objects and loops(did a really good nested loop on this, felt very pleased with myself!)and learning about Object-Orientated Design.
          Started getting a bit confused with the last one, but think I'll figure it out soon. So far, JS seems to have the almost the same rules as Python, which is great. Before I move onto Unit 2,
          "Intro to HTML/CSS", I'm going to practice my newly acquired JS skills a little bit more. I wanted to do a version of classic Nokia game Snake, but with a tweek. When you make a shape in
          JS and make it move across the screen, if you don't update the background, it leaves a trail of its past selves. If you randomize its color when it moves, you get a very pretty
           multicolor effect. So I thought I'd try to do a Snake game that uses this effect...        </p>

         I've been totally freaking out this week. Basically, I downloaded someone else's Snake code to help with my own Snake project. There wasn't anything in it that was beyond my current ability but
         nethertheless, when I try to read and decipher it I felt completely overwhelmed and got very stressed out and panicked. I shouldn't have. Within a few days I'd figured out bit by bit
        how the code worked. I'd freaked out over nothing and just needed to be more patient with myself. The last few days have been filled with unnecessary anxiety.
          From now on I need to remind myself... DON'T PANIC!<br><br>Also, while looking for Snake codes, I went on YouTube and
          started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=801s">The Coding Train.</a> This seems to be a quite popular coding channel and has loads of interesting

          then you might think. The complex bit is that you have to make an array that tracks and
          continously updates Snake's current position and it's previous position, and then draws the snake based on this. Every time the snake eats something, the array gets bigger and draws a bigger snake. You can adjust array size to change the size of Snake. If you make the array size begin as 1 space, at the start you get a 1 square sized snake. If it's 10 spaces, the snakes is 10 squares.<br>Anyway, to make my multicolor Snake I had to change the code. In my version, instead of the whole background being redrawn every frame, it only redraws the background at the last
          position in the snake array.   </p>

           This might become a habit. I started the next Khan Academy course, Intro into SQL,
           which is something I did last year on Kaggle. I didn't finish it, instead I found myself
           going back to web design. First thing I did was discover a site called FontsAwesome.
           This site contains useful and nice looking icons, just like this
           one!<i id="twelveicon"class="fas fa-desktop fa-1x" style="color: lightgreen;"></i> They look great and I've found myself wanting to use as many as possible. Secondly,
           I've been trying to design a site based around Mayor Of London posters which
           I see alot where I am, like the one  <a target=="_blank" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ebaf037e90e070832346573/fig26.jpg">linked here.</a> This pic is obviously about
           coronavirus and reminds me of New Orders Factory 51 posters. They aren't really
           supposed to be adverts but Public Information notices and come across as
           minimalist and containing no design. I did some sites based on this and other
           posters with some FontsAwesome icons and they turned out quite good.</p>

           related icon on FontsAwesome. They had a crow and a dove but I really liked this
           kiwi bird one so I've used it instead. Anyway, I finished
           Intro to SQL and I'm halfway through the next course, which is Advanced JS:
           Games and Visualization. This is more challenging then the last two courses so
           will probably take a little longer. The main task so far has been to make a 2D
           side scroller based on the famed Vietnamese android game "Flappy Bird".
           It's been a month or two since I was last coding in JS so it took a while to get
           back into the swing of things but in the end I think I did well. My game is
           called "Floaty Beaver" and is like Flappy Bird but instead of pipes you go
           through floating gates. My inspired twist on the game is that you have to go through
           them in different directions! At some point (when I've learn't how) I will put the
           game on this site, along with my Technicolor Snake game. So now I know how to make 2D scroller games and will be making more in future. Also,
           on YouTube I found a really good CSS video called <a target=="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm0IfG1GyZU&t=6s">10 modern layouts in 1 line of CSS.</a>
           This has really good codes for responsive web layouts ie; sites that adjust
           themselves based on the screensize and I'm planning on trying them all.</p>

           week I've used this nice dragon icon. I've been trying to stay with a computer theme
           but then I miss out on showing off all the other cool looking icons, so from now I'll
           use all icons that look good! I'm still doing Advanced JS. The next task in it was
           based on a Card Matching game, where you have to finds the pairs and the cards
           are dealt randomly each game. I had to add extra code for a 2-player mode, a computer
           opponent, choice of game size, card animation and other stuff. You'd think a simple
           Card Matching game would be easy to code but this has been the most challenging task on
           KA so far. The learning curve definitely goes up on Advanced JS. The hardest bit
           was coding the computer opponent. I'm sometimes not sure if it's difficult because
           it's genuinely hard or if it's just I'm not that clever and a smart person would
           find it easy. Or whether the actual course is at fault. There were a few comments
           complaining about the rise in difficulty. Oh well. I was able to do it. I set myself
           the goal of doing everything without looking at other peoples codes and I managed to, so
           I'm happy. I was surprised at some of the solutions I came up for things.  I guess the
           whole things essentially a big puzzle to solve and I've always enjoyed puzzles. So
           thing's are going well and hopefully it won't become too difficult for me.

           week a snowplow icon. I "plowed" through the rest of Advanced JS in about two days and now its finished.
           The lessons were about Transformations, 3D graphics and coding outside KA. Transformations showed you how to use rotate, push and popMatrix and translate to move the x/y coordinates around. This was easy. The 3D graphics not so easy. The KA coding enviroment doesn't do 3D graphics well so the lesson for it was mostly reading material and you are advised to try it outside of KA. Also, to do 3D graphics requires knowing trigonometry. So it looks like i'll have to do some Math lessons. For coding outside KA it recommends <a target=="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/">P5JS</a>, and also coding in your browser. It does not prepare you well for this and I've spent the last week trying to get stuff to work on P5JS. When you go on P5JS you'll find lots of syntax different to KA such as "let" used instead of "var". After a few days I found this video on <a target=="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SHaDQdul0">The Coding Train</a> that explained why. Its basically to do with KA's course being 5 years out of date. These has been one of many problems I've had. Even more difficult is trying to code in your browser. I've spent lots of hours frustrated trying to figure out how to do this, with limited success. Here's some <a target=="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCHzlUiDD10&t=117s">Coding Train vids</a> about this too.</p>

Also, I went looking for royalty free sfx and music and put these in the game too. The sfx I downloaded from <a target=="_blank" href="http://soundbible.com/"> soundbible.com</a> and the game music from <a target=="_blank" href="https://incompetech.com/">incompetch.com</a>, site of famed free music composer Kevin McCleod. After doing all this, I coded what hopefully should be above this post. Since I'm a big fan of FontAwesome's fonts and have been trying to find ways of using them more, I've ended up making a 'Fonts Clock' in JavaScript, AKA,  a 'Hieroglyph Clock'. I might do more clock based stuff in future. One idea I have is recreating an art project I saw years ago called <a target=="_blank" href="https://clockclock.com/">'CLOCK CLOCK'</a>, designed by art collective Humans since 1982. This would be a bigger challenge then my 'Font Clock'.  </p>
