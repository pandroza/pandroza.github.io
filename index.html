        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p id= "intro">This is a practice blog, charting my progress as a programmer. I first started teaching myself programming in September 2019. Today is June 11 2020. This blog dates back to 16 April, when I started Khan Academy's Computer Programming course and is written retrospectively. Ideally I'd have written these posts when they happened, when things were fresh in my mind but I'll try my best nonetheless. </p>

        <p>Today I started Intro into JavaScript. I'm going to try and do all the Khan University "computer programming" courses one after another. There's around seven of them so it will take a few months (4-6, maybe). My goal is hopefully by the end of it i'll have learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS and can use them to make websites from scratch and make games and programs. I also want be able to download and use JS code from GitHub. I'll have more skills to add to my CV, as well.  </p>

        <p>Since I've know Python, learning JavaScript is quite easy since it's basically the same thing with different syntax and I'm able to do the course quick. So far I've been learning to do basic graphics. Tasks so far include making a snowman that waves, a dinner plate with food, a animated shooting star, a fish tank, and a magic 8-ball. It's feels simplistic and for kids but I try to not stress about it,  you have to start somewhere, right?  Since coronavirus is taking over our lives, I thought I'd incorporate it into my work. So the magic 8-ball looks like a germ cell. Perhaps I could make a coronavirus based Space Invaders...     </p>

      <p>Been learning about using nested loops to print 1 image repeatedly across screen. One task was Building a house with nested loops and images from library. House looked awful. Oh well... </p>

        <p>I've finished Intro to JS! My last bunch of lessons were a 'Make it Rain' project, a 'Bookshelf' project using an Array of Objects and loops(did a really good nested loop on this, felt very pleased with myself!)and learning about Object-Orientated Design. Started getting a bit confused with the last one, but think I'll figure it out soon. So far, JS seems to have the almost the same rules as Python, which is great. Before I move onto Unit 2, "Intro to HTML/CSS", I'm going to practice my newly acquired JS skills a little bit more. I wanted to do a version of classic Nokia game Snake, but with a tweek. When you make a shape in JS and make it move across the screen, if you don't update the background, it leaves a trail of its past selves. If you randomize its color when it moves, you get a very pretty multicolor effect. So I thought I'd try to do a Snake game that uses this effect...        </p>

    <p>So, above is a picture of 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy', whose cover reminds it's readers 'DON'T PANIC'. You see, I've been totally freaking out this week. Basically, I downloaded someone else's Snake code to help with my own Snake project. There wasn't anything in it that was beyond my current ability but nethertheless, when I try to read and decipher it I felt completely overwhelmed and got very stressed out and panicked. I shouldn't have. Within a few days I'd figured out bit by bit how the code worked. I'd freaked out over nothing and just needed to be more patient with myself. The last few days have been filled with unnecessary anxiety. From now on I need to remind myself... DON'T PANIC!<br><br>Also, while looking for Snake codes, I went on YouTube and started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=801s">The Coding Train.</a> This seems to be a quite popular coding channel and has loads of interesting JS 'code-a-long videos' that I'll definitely watch soon.</p>

    <p>I've finished my Snake game! The code for a Snake game is actually more complicated then you might think. The complex bit is that you have to make an array that tracks and continously updates Snake's current position and it's previous position, and then draws the snake based on this. Every time the snake eats something, the array gets bigger and draws a bigger snake. You can adjust array size to change the size of Snake. If you make the array size begin as 1 space, at the start you get a 1 square sized snake. If it's 10 spaces, the snakes is 10 squares.<br>Anyway, to make my multicolor Snake I had to change the code. In my version, instead of the whole background being redrawn every frame, it only redraws the background at the last position in the snake array.   </p>

     <p>Did two things this week: First I watched a Coding Train video and made a animation of stars travelling at warp speed. The second thing was I made a 'Breakout' clone game. If you haven't heard of it Breakout is a very old Pong based game. It's a pretty easy game to code from scratch, and good practice.</p>
